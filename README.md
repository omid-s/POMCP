# Added Code 

We introduce human knowledge palyer into the game by introducing new modes for choosing of legal actions at each stage. 
We show this human knowledge can contribute to better policy design than that of the base line model 

# Future work

* The current human knowledge works only on cells of distance one from the node we plan to introuc more complex examples 
* We plan to do more in depth experiments with less restrictions
